  abstract    = "We consider the problem of automatically recognizing human
                 faces from frontal views with varying expression and
                 illumination, as well as occlusion and disguise. We cast the
                 recognition problem as one of classifying among multiple
                 linear regression models and argue that new theory from sparse
                 signal representation offers the key to addressing this
                 problem. Based on a sparse representation computed by
                 l\{1\}-minimization, we propose a general classification
                 algorithm for (image-based) object recognition. This new
                 framework provides new insights into two crucial issues in
                 face recognition: feature extraction and robustness to
                 occlusion. For feature extraction, we show that if sparsity in
                 the recognition problem is properly harnessed, the choice of
                 features is no longer critical. What is critical, however, is
                 whether the number of features is sufficiently large and
                 whether the sparse representation is correctly computed.
                 Unconventional features such as downsampled images and random
                 projections perform just as well as conventional features such
                 as Eigenfaces and Laplacianfaces, as long as the dimension of
                 the feature space surpasses certain threshold, predicted by
                 the theory of sparse representation. This framework can handle
                 errors due to occlusion and corruption uniformly by exploiting
                 the fact that these errors are often sparse with respect to
                 the standard (pixel) basis. The theory of sparse
                 representation helps predict how much occlusion the
                 recognition algorithm can handle and how to choose the
                 training images to maximize robustness to occlusion. We
                 conduct extensive experiments on publicly available databases
                 to verify the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and
                 corroborate the above claims.",

              identification is proposed, on the basis of a novel adaptive
              image segmentation technique (sliding concentric windows) and
              connected component analysis in conjunction with a character
              recognition neural network. The algorithm was tested with 1334
              natural-scene gray-level vehicle images of different backgrounds
              and ambient illumination. The camera focused in the plate, while
              the angle of view and the distance from the vehicle varied
              according to the experimental setup. The license plates properly
              segmented were 1287 over 1334 input images (96.5\%). The optical
              character recognition system is a two-layer probabilistic neural
              network (PNN) with topology 108-180-36, whose performance for
              entire plate recognition reached 89.1\%. The PNN is trained to
              identify alphanumeric characters from car license plates based on

              above two rates, the overall rate of success for the
              license-plate-recognition algorithm is 86.0\%. A review in the
              related literature presented in this paper reveals that better

  abstract  = "Object recognition is one of the major research topics in the
               field of computer vision. In robotics, there is often a need for
               a system that can locate certain objects in the environment -
               the capability which we denote as 'object detection'. In this
               paper, we present a new method for object detection. The method
               is especially suitable for detecting objects in natural scenes,
               as it is able to cope with problems such as complex background,
               varying illumination and object occlusion. The proposed method
               uses the receptive field representation where each pixel in the
               image is represented by a combination of its color and response
               to different filters. Thus, the cooccurrence of certain filter
               responses within a specific radius in the image serves as
               information basis for building the representation of the object.
               The specific goal in this paper is the development of an online
               learning scheme that is effective after just one training
               example but still has the ability to improve its performance
               with more time and new examples. We describe the details behind
               the algorithm and demonstrate its strength with an extensive

  abstract = "Automatic license plate recognition (LPR) plays an important role
              in numerous applications and a number of techniques have been
              proposed. However, most of them worked under restricted
              conditions, such as fixed illumination, limited vehicle speed,
              designated routes, and stationary backgrounds. In this study, as
              few constraints as possible on the working environment are
              considered. The proposed LPR technique consists of two main
              modules: a license plate locating module and a license number
              identification module. The former characterized by fuzzy
              disciplines attempts to extract license plates from an input
              image, while the latter conceptualized in terms of neural
              subjects aims to identify the number present in a license plate.
              Experiments have been conducted for the respective modules. In
              the experiment on locating license plates, 1088 images taken from
              various scenes and under different conditions were employed. Of
              which, 23 images have been failed to locate the license plates
              present in the images; the license plate location rate of success
              is 97.9\%. In the experiment on identifying license number, 1065
              images, from which license plates have been successfully located,
              were used. Of which, 47 images have been failed to identify the
              numbers of the license plates located in the images; the
              identification rate of success is 95.6\%. Combining the above two
              rates, the overall rate of success for our LPR algorithm is

              A sensing system with a wide dynamic range has been developed to
              acquire fine images of vehicles under varied illumination
              conditions. The developed sensing system can expand the dynamic
              range of the image by combining a pair of images taken under
              different exposure conditions. In order to avert blurring of
              images against fast passing vehicles, a prism beam splitter
              installed a multilayered filter, and two charge-coupled devices
              are utilized to capture those images simultaneously. Furthermore,
              to extend the flexibility of camera placement, a recognition
              algorithm that can be applied to inclined plates has been
              developed. The performance of recognizing registration numbers on
              license plates has been investigated on real images of about 1000
              vehicles captured under various illumination conditions.
              Recognition rates of over 99\% (conventional plates) and over
              97\% (highly inclined plates) showed that the developed system is

              are generally composed of the following three processing steps:
              1) extraction of a license plate region; 2) segmentation of the
              plate characters; and 3) recognition of each character. This task
              is quite challenging due to the diversity of plate formats and
              the nonuniform outdoor illumination conditions during image
              acquisition. Therefore, most approaches work only under
              restricted conditions such as fixed illumination, limited vehicle
              speed, designated routes, and stationary backgrounds. Numerous
              techniques have been developed for LPR in still images or video
              sequences, and the purpose of this paper is to categorize and
              assess them. Issues such as processing time, computational power,
              and recognition rate are also addressed, when available. Finally,
              this paper offers to researchers a link to a public image
              database to define a common reference point for LPR algorithmic

              multiresolution approach to gray-scale and rotation invariant
              texture classification based on local binary patterns and
              nonparametric discrimination of sample and prototype
              distributions. The method is based on recognizing that certain
              local binary patterns, termed ``uniform,'' are fundamental
              properties of local image texture and their occurrence histogram
              is proven to be a very powerful texture feature. We derive a
              generalized gray-scale and rotation invariant operator

              for any quantization of the angular space and for any spatial
              resolution and presents a method for combining multiple operators
              for multiresolution analysis. The proposed approach is very
              robust in terms of gray-scale variations since the operator is,
              by definition, invariant against any monotonic transformation of
              the gray scale. Another advantage is computational simplicity as
              the operator can be realized with a few operations in a small
              neighborhood and a lookup table. Experimental results demonstrate
              that good discrimination can be achieved with the occurrence

                   technology have resulted in the availability of lucrative

                   users all the time. All resources are accessible, but there
                   is a single point of control as well as a single point of
                   failure. The integration of computer and networking
                   technologies gave birth to new paradigm of computing called
                   distributed computing in the late 1970s. Distributed

                   quick and precise solutions for a variety of complex
                   problems for different fields. Nowadays, we are fully

                   a few magnitudes, abiding end systems increasingly to
                   communicate in more and more different ways. Over the years,

  abstract  = "This paper proposes a method which evaluates symmetry of plate
               corners and extracts car license plates captured from the
               arbitrary directions. The generalized symmetry transform (GST)
               produces continuous features of symmetry between two points by
               combining locality constraint and reflectional symmetry. Also,
               we propose scan line based GST to improve time complexity of the
               GST significantly due to selective attention to particular
               distortions in case of a large searching window. The corners of
               a plate are detected from our modified scan line based GST with
               selective directions using the fact that a corner is formed by
               two neighboring straight lines acquired in a symmetry map of
               GST. However, a rotated or perspectively distorted car license
               plate image is very difficult for segmentation of interior
               characters. Image normalization by image warping is adopted to
               make such segmentation of license plate and later identification
               much easier. We also adopt the verifier which evaluates a
               candidate license plate to enhance extraction rate. Our
               experiments show that the proposed method for extracting
               perspectively distorted license plates is fairly reliable",

  abstract  = "This paper describes a machine learning approach for visual
               object detection which is capable of processing images extremely
               rapidly and achieving high detection rates. This work is
               distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the
               introduction of a new image representation called the ``integral
               image'' which allows the features used by our detector to be
               computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based
               on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual
               features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient
               classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining
               increasingly more complex classifiers in a ``cascade'' which
               allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded
               while spending more computation on promising object-like
               regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific
               focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches
               provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are
               unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of
               face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to
               the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the
               detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image

              histogram equalization is employed to solve the low-contrast and
              dynamic-range problems; the texture properties, e.g., aspect
              ratio, and color similarity are used to locate the LP; and the

              segment the characters in the dirt LP. The feedback self-learning

  abstract    = "This paper presents a neural network based artificial vision
                 system able to analyze the image of a car given by a camera,
                 locate the registration plate and recognize the registration
                 number of the car. The paper describes in detail various
                 practical problems encountered in implementing this particular
                 application and the solutions used to solve them. The main
                 features of the system presented are: controlled
                 stability-plasticity behavior, controlled reliability
                 threshold, both off-line and on-line learning, self assessment
                 of the output reliability and high reliability based on high
                 level multiple feedback. The system has been designed using a
                 modular approach. Sub-modules can be upgraded and/or
                 substituted independently, thus making the system potentially
                 suitable in a large variety of vision applications. The OCR
                 engine was designed as an interchangeable plug-in module. This
                 allows the user to choose an OCR engine which is suited to the
                 particular application and to upgrade it easily in the future.
                 At present, there are several versions of this OCR engine. One
                 of them is based on a fully connected feedforward artificial
                 neural network with sigmoidal activation functions. This
                 network can be trained with various training algorithms such
                 as error backpropagation. An alternative OCR engine is based
                 on the constraint based decomposition (CBD) training
                 architecture. The system has showed the following performances
                 (on average) on real-world data: successful plate location and
                 segmentation about 99\%, successful character recognition
                 about 98\% and successful recognition of complete registration
